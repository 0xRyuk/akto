  message: >
            "Attacker can access resources of any user by replacing method of the endpoint (eg: changemethod from get to post). This way attacker can get access to unauthorized endpoints.",
            "The endpoint appears to be vulnerable to broken function level authorization attack. The original request was replayed with the addition of request parameter " +
            "(for example: {method = GET} was added to change it to GET method) in query params." +
            " The application responded with 2XX success codes and the response body match was less than <b>{{percentageMatch}}%</b>.<br><br>" +
            "<b>Background:</b> Some web frameworks provide a way to override the actual HTTP method in the request by emulating the missing HTTP verbs passing some custom parameter in query params. " +
            "The main purpose of this is to circumvent some middleware (e.g. proxy, firewall) limitation where methods allowed usually do not encompass verbs such as PUT or DELETE."
