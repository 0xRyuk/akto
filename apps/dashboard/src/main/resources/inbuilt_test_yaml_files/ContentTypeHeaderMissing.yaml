  details: >
            "The endpoint appears to be vulnerable to broken object level authorization attack. The original request
            was replayed with attacker's auth token. The server responded with 2XX success codes and greater
            than <b>{{percentageMatch}}%</b> of the response body matched with original response body. Also, the endpoint had atleast one private
            resources in request payload.<br>"
            "<b>Background:</b> Object level authorization is an access control mechanism that is usually implemented at the code level to
             validate that one user can only access objects that they should have access to.
            Unauthorized access can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation. Unauthorized access to objects can also lead to full account takeover."
  impact: "Unauthorized access can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation. Unauthorized access to objects can also lead to full account takeover."
